1. **How often do you send survey through internet or mail, yearly or monthly?  How long will it take to collect all the responses? Whole year or half year or several months?**

   The American Community Survey is conducted monthly through an invitation that is mailed to over 3.5 million housing addresses to respond online (internet).  Once the data is collected for the specific period of time (1 year or 5 year estimates) the data is released on an annual basis.  If a household does not respond through the internet, then a paper (hard copy) questionnaire is mailed to the address for the household to complete and mail back.  All invitations mailed out contain a User ID, which is how the Census Bureau tracks whether or not a household has responded.  If a response is neither received through internet or mail, the Census Bureau may send a representative out to conduct the survey.  Once responses are received it takes the Census Bureau nearly a year to collect and create the statistics for dissemination to the public. 
 
2. **What are the follow up strategies? For example, If a household doesn’t not respond, how often will acs to resend the survey?**

   If a household does not respond to the ACS survey either through the first step of the internet invitation, or the second step of the paper questionnaire to mail back, reminders are sent to the housing address to remind the respondents to reply to the survey.  If a response is still not received the household could be selected for what is known as CAPI interview.  CAPI basically means that a representative will personally come out and interview the household.
 
3. **What are the percentage of people who are selected to get in person interviews? How many accepted?**

   A household may be selected for personal interviewing (CAPI) if it does not respond via internet or mail.  About 25% of households are selected for CAPI interviewing.

4. **What’s the best way to collect survey data via different approaches? Mail? In person? Internet? What’s the percentage of each one?**

   There are several effective ways to collect data and this varies based on the population or group being surveyed.  The Census Bureau prefers to collect data via the internet.  Completing the survey by internet is best because is places less burden on the respondent, is the most time-effective, as well as cost efficient.  The questions on the survey are the same regardless the approach to conduct the interview.
 
5. **Any other ways ACS did to boost response time and response rate that has great improvement?**

   The data collection through the internet started in 2013.  ACS also frequently updates the survey questions and content to make it easier for respondents to respond.
