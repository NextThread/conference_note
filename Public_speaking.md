Enthusiasm / Rapport -----> 
enthusiasm:
Thy this are? Tell a story
Why this work is important? Tell the,
Rappoer:
pertaining to the connection between audients and you

How to buid rapport:
show pictures of key contributors;
say why talk is so important

gain rapport by including everyone:
introduction, conclusion and transitions should be understood by everyone

The ending summaries main points and places those results in the context of the big picture

How to make slides:

Typography should be Arial or Calibri, 18 to 28 points
Avoiding using all capital letters

You are selling yourself.

Key points:
---->Respect audience
---->passion
---->tell a story

Timing of talk:
prepare a 2-hour talk much faster than a 20 minutes talk
once you are rushing to finish you have lost the audience
how can you be surprised you have 5 minutes left

Passion:
need to show you enjoy your work
humor/analogies, anecdotes: help my story

Telling a story:
present why; whats the issue; present the solution; finish the story
!!!!!!Nobody wants to see your summer vacation videos!!!!!!!
Not a chronology of your work
true in consulting , true here


The Speed presentation and posters;


Back to Dick de:
Some hints for a great presentation;
Give suggestions for non_english speakers; (Still have accent and will have accent)
Cover 70% just a little slow;

Five Questions (ASA Website):
Whats the question/ Why (motivation)
Whats has been done about it
WHat you are doing about it
what additional value
what are you doing here

Things to keep in mind:
not everyone has read your papers
not everything has the same technical ability
It will take more time and effort to prepare a great presention than you think (or want)
It took you years to understand the probelem, help people throught it during the next 15 minutes. do not expect them to get it
making people feel smart is okay
Tell to your audience -tell yuo story


Myth #1 
there is only one way to give an effective
(do not cipy someone else. be yourself)
Style is personal

Myth #2
there is no place for humor in a scholarly presentation

Myth #3
I have done the reseach. I am done. 
(Rehears the research)

Mythn #4
I have to tell everthing that I have done;
(do nt have to)

Myth #5
I cannot do it

Somehting to remember
The audience wants to succeed;
Two tricks to relax:
11 o' clock always comes
Always imagine someone loves you so much sitting in row 8;

Ask feedbacks from english speaker; Speak slowly thats how they understand it. Slow is fine.
Help to prepare: Breathe; repeat; Thats a great question, I will get back to you. During your presentation, you know more about it. Not fake you understand or you know the answer.
